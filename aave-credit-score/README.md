# Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring

This project generates a credit score for each wallet interacting with the Aave V2 protocol based on historical transaction behavior. The score ranges from 0 to 1000 — with higher scores indicating responsible, reliable usage, and lower scores flagging potentially risky or exploitative activity.

---

## 🚀 Objective

- Create a behavior-based credit scoring model for DeFi wallets.
- Use transaction-level data from Aave V2 (deposit, borrow, repay, liquidation, etc.)
- Output a credit score between **0–1000** per wallet.

## ⚙️ Features Engineered

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `total_deposits` | Total amount deposited |
| `total_borrows` | Total amount borrowed |
| `total_repays` | Total amount repaid |
| `borrow_repay_ratio` | Repayments relative to borrows |
| `num_deposits` | Number of deposit actions |
| `num_liquidations` | Number of liquidation events |
| `unique_tokens_used` | Diversity of tokens used |
| `avg_time_between_actions` | Frequency of wallet activity |
| `redeem_to_deposit_ratio` | Risky churn behavior indicator |

## 🧮 Scoring Logic

Final Score = Weighted sum of normalized features:

- **25%** – Repayment behavior (repay/borrow)
- **15%** – Total deposits
- **15%** – Number of deposits
- **15%** – Token diversity
- **10%** – Inverse liquidation count
- **10%** – Inverse redemption ratio
- **10%** – Frequency of wallet usage
